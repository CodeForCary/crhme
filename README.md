Tool to extract crime data from the Town of Cary website
http://policereports.townofcary.org/dailybulletin.aspx

crhme (pronounced as “crummy” as in “it’s totally crummy that there’s not an API for this data”) is a script to extract crime data from the Town of Cary website at policereports.townofcary.org. 

The project name is derived from the base-32 value for CRIME less 1,024 (take a byte out of crime, get it? — McGruff the Crime Dog is pictured on the web page) which results in a base-32 value CRHME.
